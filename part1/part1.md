Part 1a
1. values added: 20
2. final result: 20
3. values added: 20
4. Error. Because result is not defined outside of if block.
5. Error. Because we have assignment to constant value result.
6. Error. Even if we comment out line 9, it still is not defined outside of if block.

Part 1b
1. 3. Because the for loop will stop when i == length of prices = 3
2. 150. Because this var is 300 discount 50% when the loop stops.
3. 150. Same, because 150 after rounding is still 150.
4. It will return an array [50. 100, 150]
